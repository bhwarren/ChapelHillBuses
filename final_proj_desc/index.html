    <h1> Final Project, Comp 426: Nextbus Redesign </h1> 
        <p> Team: Bo Warren, Alex Parker, Aaron Brown </p>
    <h2> Description </h2> 
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to re-design the Next Bus website so that we can list routes based solely on stops, rather than just looking at times by selecting a route and then a stop.  This should ease the search for finding multiple buses that go to the same place, and allow the arrival times to be compared.  </p> 
    <h2> Details </h2>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will start out with a mockup, and expand the user interface from there. The user should be able to select just a stop or just a route and have results displayed which matches the input. The backend will be a realational database with list of routes, stops, and times, which can be queried and displayed back to the user once a specific stop is selected.</p>
